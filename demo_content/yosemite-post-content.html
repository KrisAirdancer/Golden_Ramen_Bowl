<h2>Day 1 – Driving &amp; Curry Village</h2>



<p>With a 10 hour drive ahead of us we made only one stop aside from the gas station – The Bonneville Salt Flats. Not much to see here other than vast expanses of hard-packed sand and salt. Oh! And some smoke this year…</p>

<p>By the time we arrived in Yosemite NP we had just enough light to check in at Curry Village. Curry Village was the only place that had openings when we went looking to make reservations to camp in the park, otherwise we would have camped in a tent. Although we paid a bit more for the tents, we got a bed and a place to store our stuff which was nice.</p>



<p>We also discovered that the Ziploc bags we had stored our food (mostly sandwiches) in were not waterproof and had leaked, soaking all of our food… Great start to the trip! </p>



<p>We salvaged what we could then dropped by the Village Store to resupply.</p>

<p>There was some good news however. We got permits to climb the Half Dome for the next day. We had applied for permits several months before and not gotten them (lottery system), so we had started applying to their daily lottery the 2 days leading up to the trip and got lucky!</p>



<h2>Day 2 – Half Dome &amp; (No) Shoes</h2>



<p>The next morning we hopped up as early as we could, filled water, and began our hike to the trailhead for the Half Dome excited that we managed to get permits.</p>



<p>The added benefit of Half Dome permits is that the trail to the Half Dome begins at the end of the trail for Vernal and Nevada falls, so you get to do all three in one go.</p>



<p>Yosemite Valley is a bit dry this time of year and this year in particular had been extra dry, so most of the falls had barely a trickle of water coming over them. But these two were fun to see anyway.</p>



<img src="/images/bagel.webp"><figcaption>Vernal Falls and a colorful bagel! And smoke…</figcaption></figure>



<p>The hike to the top of Nevada Falls, the farthest of the two, is about 2.7 miles from the trailhead and is quite steep. The last few sections have a large number of stairs to climb making it both a difficult and unique trail – I personally like the aesthetic of the stone stairs.</p>



<img src="/images/nevada-falls.webp"><figcaption>Nevada Falls.</figcaption>



<p>We took a quick break a the top Nevada Falls before continuing another 3.5-4 miles to the base of Half Dome. This part of the trail was scenic and flat which provided some respite from the Stairmaster 5000 (I really should have counted the stairs on the way up).</p>



<p>At the Sub-Dome, just below the Half Dome, we had to have a ranger check our permits before heading up and we took the opportunity to grab some lunch in the shade as it had gotten hot already and the rest of the trip to the top was going to be pretty exposed.</p>



<p>Climbing the Sub-Dome was a short but fun adventure along a series of stone stairs carved into the rock and large flat slabs of granodiorite (Kinda like granite?). At the top we reached the base of the Half Dome, the reason for the long walk and the place where things get slippery.</p>



<img src="/images/half-dome.webp"><figcaption>The Half Dome from the Sub-Dome. Human for scale.</figcaption>



<p>The route to the top of the Half Dome is straightforward, but that’s about it. It’s a couple of cables and 2×4’s leading straight up the side of the dome. From the bottom it doesn’t look too bad, but it is really quite steep. So much so that if you let go of the cables and don’t have your feet on one of the 2×4’s, you will slide straight to the bottom.</p>



<p>When we started up we quickly learned how slick the stone can be and after making it only about a quarter of the way up we returned to the bottom to regroup.</p>



<p>Vista felt that she could make it, but my shoes were acting like ice-on-ice. So I took them off. Problem solved.</p>



<img src="/images/no-shoes.webp"><figcaption>No shoes! Problem solved.</figcaption>



<p>After making this minor adjustment to my footwear, we made our way to the top. Something that must have taken a solid 30-45 minutes due to having to stop and pass people on the way up, which is not that easy.</p>



<p>Once at the top we had what would normally have been a great view of Yosemite Valley, but anyone following the news this year would know that the West coast was dealing with an unreasonable number of fires this year, meaning smoke for everyone! We could see everything from the top, but it was through a gray haze that spread out as far as we could see. Kind of sad if you think about it.</p>



<p>After a short break at the top, we opted to head back down as the sun was out in full force and the smoke didn’t seem to slow it down much.</p>



<p>Down-climbing the Half Dome was about as difficult as climbing it and involved another round of juggling people, but overall not too bad. Although, my feet were starting to get toasty on the rock, so getting my shoes back on was most welcome.</p>



<p>The hike back out was, of course, just the reverse of the hike in.</p>



<p>Despite the 8+ mile round-trip hike, we still managed to make it back to camp by 4PM, which gave us some time to relax and meet the folks in the tent next to us who were surprised that we’d done the whole thing as fast as we did. We felt like we’d been a bit slow to be honest.</p>



<h3>Yosemite Falls</h3>



<p>Thanks to the extra time we had we were able to ride our bikes over to Yosemite Falls. Bringing the bikes ended up being a great idea. They made it super easy to get around in the park and ensured we didn’t have to risk loosing our parking space any more than we needed to.</p>



<p>Yosemite Falls, like Vernal and Nevada Falls, was lacking in water. In fact, Vernal and Nevada Falls looked pretty good in comparison. Yosemite Falls had only the smallest trickle of water coming over the edge. By the time it fell the 2400 feet to the bottom, it was just a mist.</p>



<img src="/images/ya-falls.webp"><figcaption>Yosemite “falls”</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a much different experience than I’d had the last time I’d visited Yosemite. When I first visited, the falls were flowing in full force and the trail at the bottom was covered in the spray of the falls. Oh well, we’ll come back.</p>



<p>After our short visit to Yosemite Falls, we returned to camp, ate some food, and went to bed. We were exhausted.</p>



<h2>Day 3 – Art Day</h2>



<p>The next day we took a rest day and broke out our painting/sketching gear to do a bit of art. We set up camp on “The Deck” in Curry Village, a crowded deck outside a pizza shop with round umbrella covered tables. The crowd would make you think this is the only place to get food in the valley.</p>



<img src="/images/the-deck.webp"><figcaption>My painting of the The Deck.</figcaption>



<p>Vista did an acrylic painting of a view of Yosemite Valley from a reference photo we found on the internet – The Deck was the only place to sit with shade – and I did a mix of sketching random things around us and did a watercolor painting of The Deck pizza shop.</p>



<p>The heat and the wind gave Vista a hard time by drying her paints out pretty quickly, forcing her to re-mix colors much more often. My watercolors proved impervious to the weather.</p>



<p>We spent the entire day on The Deck painting away and watching the over-fed squirrels attempt to steal food from people – most people were feeding them. Don’t be these people.</p>



<p>Near the end of the day, one of the guys that works in the pizza shop stopped by to see what we were doing. He apparently liked my painting enough to offer us “two beers and a pizza” if I’d give it to him. I was tempted, and when we bought a pizza from them, he withheld it for a minute to try and bargain with me before I paid for the pizza.</p>



<p>In the end I opted to keep the painting.</p>

<h2>Day 4 – Sentinel Dome &amp; Glacier Point</h2>



<p>Today wasn’t too busy. We decided to drive over to Sentinel Dome and Glacier Point in the morning to catch some morning views of Yosemite Valley.</p>



<p>We finally found the tunnel that I remember you driving through to get into the park – it is on the opposite side of the valley from where we first entered. I’d been looking for it the entire trip!</p>



<p>Up on Sentinel Dome, Vista finally got some cell service and was able to check her email. She’d just interviewed for an internship with Amazon a few weeks back and was waiting to hear back. We got good news. She’d been offered an internship! Aside from managing to make it to the top of the Half Dome, this was probably the most exciting part of the trip.</p>



<img src="/images/sentinal-dome.webp"><figcaption>The view of Half Dome from Sentinel Dome. Smoke cleared up a bit.</figcaption>



<p>We grabbed gas on the way back into the valley – there isn’t any in the valley and we’d been putting off driving to the station a few miles out of the park. We filled up with about an eighth of a tank left. :(



<p>We spent the rest of the day just hanging out on the valley floor. I decided to paint another picture. This time of the tent across from ours in Curry Village. It turned out alright…</p>

<h2>Day 5 – Yosemite Falls &amp; a Long Drive</h2>



<p>Today was our last day in Yosemite NP. We had a bit of a drive to Sequoia NP after this, but opted to hike Yosemite Falls in the morning before leaving.</p>



<p>We managed to hit the trail early after packing everything into the car, and were able to reach the top by around 10AM for some more fantastic views of smoke in the valley.</p>



<p>The good news though was that we were the only ones up there.</p>



<img src="/images/ya-falls-top.webp"><figcaption>On top of Yosemite Falls.</figcaption>



<p>On the way out of the park, we also found the location where the photo Vista painted a few days ago was taken from.</p>



<img src="/images/vistas-painting.webp"><figcaption>Vista with her painting.</figcaption>



<p>The dive to Sequoia was also smokey, but we kept ourselves entertained. Eventually we arrived in Sequoia, where we had to drive to the other end of the park to reach our campsite – it was the only one available when we were making reservations. Now, that said, the name of the site was Princess Campground, so naturally Vista was excited to stay there.</p>



<p>After checking in at the campsite and setting up camp, we drove back into the park to check out a few of the close to the road attractions, like Tunnel Log, Moro Rock, etc. (I honestly can’t remember all of the names now that I’m writing this so late. Oops!)</p>



<img src="/images/tunnel-log.webp"><figcaption>Tunnel Log.</figcaption>



<p>Moro Rock and Tunnel Log were the highlights at this point (Obviously, they’re the only ones I remember the names of!). Moro Rock, of course, gave us some more smokey views, but Tunnel Log surprised us a bit. Turns out that the tree fell on December 4, 1937, 58 years to the day before Vista was born – she insisted on a photo with the sign.</p>



<img src="/images/vista-b-day.webp"><figcaption>Happy birthday Vista and Tunnel Log Tree.</figcaption>



<p>After checking things out it was getting dark, so we retired to our tent.</p>



<h2>Day 6 – Hiking Among Giants &amp; Crystal Cave</h2>



<p>Today we started with a hike in Crescent Meadows which was essentially a giant nature walk with super-sized treed.</p>



<img src="/images/crescent-meadow.webp"><figcaption>Crescent Meadow, Sequoia NP.</figcaption>



<p>Along the way we saw a log that had been turned into a cabin (Tharp’s Log), Chimney Tree, Lincoln Tree, McKinley Tree, General Lee Tree, Chief Sequoyah Tree, The Senate (a group of trees), and The President Tree.</p>



<img src="/images/tharps-log.webp"><figcaption>Tharp’s Log.</figcaption>



<p>We also found the entrances to several evil villains’ lairs. Just see for yourself.</p>



<img src="/images/evil-lair.webp"><figcaption>Definitely some evil going on down there.</figcaption>



<p>This was actually a pretty good hike. The smoke cleared up for a decent part of it and there weren’t that many people on the trail, so we got to enjoy being out in the forest by ourselves, which was nice.</p>



<p>In fact, we almost walked all the way over to the General Sherman Tree, but opted out and drove instead. It was right off the road after all.</p>



<p>This is where the people were. G. Sherman Tree was packed! We didn’t stick around too long. Just long enough to grab a picture.</p>



<p>At this point we didn’t have a huge amount of time left before we had to get down to Crystal Cave for a tour – a tour in a cave! But we felt we would have enough time to drive out and see Tunnel Rock. It ended up being quite the drive out and back due to the crazy number of switchbacks in the road the forced traffic to go really slow.</p>


<img src="/images/tunnel-rock.webp"><figcaption>Tunnel Rock.</figcaption>



<p>After walking around under the rock for a minute, we drove back to get to Crystal Cave and managed it with about 30 minutes to spare.</p>



<p>I drew a picture of their small bookstore while we waited for the tour to start and Vista perused their wares.</p>



<p>The cave tour ended up being our favorite part of our visit to Sequoia NP. Not much to describe here, but the the caves are pretty unique, so it’s always fun to visit them.</p>



<img src="/images/crystal-cave-entrance.webp"><figcaption>This is definitely an evil lair. Or maybe just the entrance to Crystal Cave…</figcaption>



<p>After the tour, however, Vista managed to one-up the cave tour, moving it to second place. On the drive back to the campsite, we saw not one but two bears. One of which was smack in the middle of the road. Vista was super excited.</p>



<p>Before arriving back at the campsite, we also stopped to take a picture at Vista Point – of course we had to.</p>

<h2>Day 7 – Vegas! Or maybe Vegas…</h2>



<p>The cave tour was the last real part of our trip and today was time to head back to SLC. We left as early as we could to ensure that we didn’t end up arriving back too late.</p>



<p>On the way back through Nevada, we opted to drive down the Vegas strip. Vista hadn’t been before (I have and would have driven straight through) and wanted to see it. So we took a detour and drove down the strip to check out all of the funny looking buildings and busy streets. We also stopped for a McDonald’s burger.</p>



<p>Vista thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
