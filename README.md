# Golden_Ramen_Bowl
A scratch built personal website for me and my wife.

The current version of this site is built using Wordpress and can be viewed [here](https://www.goldenramenbowl.com).

This site might eventually replace the current one and be hosted on our Raspberry Pi instead of on Bluehost.

## Setting up this project for development

- 1. Clone the repository to local.
- 2. Run 'npm install' in the terminal to download all of the requried dependencies.
    - The required dependencies are listed in the projects.json file and will be downloaded by this command.
- 3. The project can now be run using either,
    - 'nodemon app' to run using Nodemon
    - 'node app' to run using vanilla Node.js
